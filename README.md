mobile apps and connected devices. It allows you to create, edit & manage content in the cloud
and publish it anywhere via powerful API. Contentful offers tools for managing editorial

## What does `contentful_bootstrap` do?
The aim of `contentful_bootstrap` is to have developers setting up their Contentful environment
in a single command

## How to Use

### Installation

$ gem install contentful_bootstrap
```

### Usage

You can create spaces by doing

$ contentful_bootstrap create_space <space_name> [--template template_name] [--json-template template_path] [--config CONFIG_PATH]
```


You can also generate new Delivery API Tokens by doing:

$ contentful_bootstrap generate_token <space_id> [--name token_name] [--config CONFIG_PATH]
```

### Available templates

The available templates for your spaces are:

```

```

This will get you started with Contentful by setting up a Space with some Demo Data to get you
started as soon as possible with development using our API.

### Using from within other applications

Include `contentful_bootstrap` to your project's `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem "contentful_bootstrap"
```

Require `contentful_bootstrap`

```ruby
require 'contentful/bootstrap'
```

To Create a new Space

```ruby
Contentful::Bootstrap::Commands.new.create_space("space_name")
```

Additionally, you can send an options hash with the following keys:

```ruby
options = {
  template: "blog", # Will use one of the predefined templates and create Content Types, Assets and Entries
  json_template: "/path/to/template.json", # Will use the JSON file specified as a Template
  trigger_oauth: true # if true will trigger OAuth process
}
Contentful::Bootstrap::Commands.new.create_space("space_name", options)
```

To Create a new Delivery API Token

```ruby
Contentful::Bootstrap::Commands.new.generate_token("space_id")
```

Additionally, you can send an options hash with the following keys:

```ruby
options = {
  name: "Some Nice Token Name", # Will Create the Delivery API Token with the specified name
  trigger_oauth: true # if true will trigger OAuth process
}
Contentful::Bootstrap::Commands.new.create_space("space_name", options)
```

Optionally, `Commands#new` will take a parameter for specifying a configuration path

### Configuration

Contentful Bootstrap will read by default from `~/.contentfulrc`, but you can provide your own
file by using the `--config CONFIG_PATH` parameter

If you don't have `~/.contentfulrc` created, you will be prompted if you want to create it

#### Configuration Format

The configuration file will be in `ini` format and looks like the following

```ini
[global]
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_ACCESS_TOKEN = a_management_access_token
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_ACCESS_TOKEN = a_delivery_acces_token      ; Delivery Access Token is not required for this tool, but can be generated by it
```

### JSON Templates

You can find a complete example [here](./examples/templates/catalogue.json)
